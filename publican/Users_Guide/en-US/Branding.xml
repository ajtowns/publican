		<firstterm>Brands</firstterm> are collections of files that <application>Publican</application> uses to apply a consistent look and style to HTML and PDF output. They provide boilerplate text that appears at the beginning of documents, images such as logos, and stylistic elements such as color schemes. <application>Publican</application> ships with one brand, <filename>common/</filename>. Documentation projects can produce and distribute brands to their contributors, either as a package (for example, an RPM package) or as an archive (for example, a tarball or ZIP file).
