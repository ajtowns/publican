	<title>Creating, installing, and updating product pages and version pages</title>
	<para>
		<application>Publican</application>-generated product pages and version pages are the localizable pages that provide a general overview of a product or version respectively. Visitors access these pages by clicking on a product or version in the navigation menu. The pages are structured as DocBook <sgmltag>&lt;article&gt;</sgmltag>s with an extra <parameter>web_type:&nbsp;product</parameter> or <parameter>web_type:&nbsp;version</parameter> parameter in their <filename>publican.cfg</filename> files. In their structure and presentation, product pages and version pages are the same as any other article that you produce with <application>Publican</application> and are packaged the same way.
	</para>
	<procedure>
		<step>
			<para>
				On a workstation, create a product or version page using the procedure described in <xref linkend="sect-Users_Guide-Website-structure-product-version-manual" />.
			</para>
		</step>
		<step>
			<para>
				In the directory in which you created the product page or version page, run: 
			</para>
<screen><prompt>$</prompt> <prompt>$</prompt> <command>publican package --binary</command></screen>
			<para>
				<application>Publican</application> builds an RPM package and places it in the <filename>/tmp/rpms/noarch/</filename> directory of the product page or version page. By default, <application>Publican</application> builds the RPM package for the operating system within which you are running <application>Publican</application>. To build an RPM package to install on a server that runs a different operating system, set the <parameter>os_ver</parameter> parameter in the <filename>publican.cfg</filename> file of the product page or version page. 
			</para>
		</step>
		<step>
			<para>
				Either upload the package to the webserver and install it with the <command>rpm -i</command> or <command>yum localinstall</command> command, or place the package in a repository and configure the webserver to install from that repository when you run <command>yum install</command>.
			</para>
		</step>
	</procedure>
	<para>
		To update the product page or version page, build a new package with a higher <sgmltag>&lt;edition&gt;</sgmltag> number or <sgmltag>&lt;pubsnumber&gt;</sgmltag> in the  <filename>Article_Info.xml</filename>. <application>Publican</application> uses these values to set the version and release numbers for the RPM package. When you install this package on your webserver, <application>yum</application> can replace the old version with the new when you run <command>yum localinstall</command> for a local package, or <command>yum update</command> for a package fetched from a repository.
