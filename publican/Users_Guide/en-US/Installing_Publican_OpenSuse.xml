      <title>OpenSuse 12</title>

      <para><application>Publican</application> has not been usable on
      OpenSuse up until release 12.1. Certain dependencies were missing and
      could not be found in any known OpenSuse repository. This is not the
      case with OpenSuse 12.1 as all dependencies can now be found and
      installed.</para>

      <para>The following instructions describe installing
      <application>Publican</application> from source because, as yet, there
      is no <application>Publican</application> RPM for OpenSuse 12.1. The
      version of <application>Publican</application> is 2.9 taken directly
      from the source repository - previous versions have not been tested but
      may work.</para>

      <para>At the time of writing, Publican 2.8 was the release version and
      work on 2.9 was still ongoing. For this reason the following
      instructions are subject to change.</para>

      <para>The OpenSuse install was a default one with the following software
      categories added at install time:</para>

      <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
        <listitem>
          <para>Technical Writing - for the Docbook tools etc.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Perl Development</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Web and LAMP Server</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The system used had KDE installed which shouldn't make a
      difference. The following KDE specific categories were also
      installed:</para>

      <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
        <listitem>
          <para>KDE Development</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Desktop Effects</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Finally, the entire Games category was removed.</para>

      <para>After OpenSuse had completed installing, and all current updates
      had been applied, the following steps were followed to install
      <application>Publican</application>.</para>

      <procedure>
        <step>
          <para>Open a terminal session.</para>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para>Install the dependencies that are available from various
          online repositories - many of these are not present in the
          installation DVD repository.</para>

          <note>
            <para><filename>Liberation-fonts</filename> is most likely already
            installed, but it is required. <application>Zypper</application>
            will not reinstall it if it is already present.</para>
          </note>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para>Use <application>cpan</application> to install the remaining
          dependencies which cannot be installed by
          <application>zypper</application>:</para>

          <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <command>sudo sh
cpan File::pushd File::Copy::Recursive Locale::PO pp \
Syntax::Highlight::Engine::Kate XML::TreeBuilder
exit
</command></screen>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para>Download the source code:</para>

          <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <command>cd ~
mkdir -p SourceCode/publican
cd SourceCode/publican
svn checkout http://svn.fedorahosted.org/svn/publican/branches/publican-2x ./
</command></screen>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para>Build the <application>Publican</application> build
          script:</para>

          <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <command>perl Build.PL
</command></screen>

          <para>If all the dependencies are installed, you should see the
          following:</para>

          <screen><computeroutput>WARNING: the following files are missing in your kit:</computeroutput>
<computeroutput>        META.yml</computeroutput>
<computeroutput> Please inform the author.</computeroutput>

<computeroutput>Created MYMETA.yml and MYMETA.json</computeroutput>
<computeroutput>Creating new 'Build' script for 'Publican' version '2.9'</computeroutput></screen>

          <para>If not, then use <application>cpan</application> (as root) to
          install the missing modules and run the build again. Replace any
          forward slashes '/' by a double colon '::' and make sure you use
          exactly the same letter case, for example: If
          <filename>File/pushd.pm</filename> is reported as missing, you would
          use this to install it:</para>

          <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <command>sudo sh
cpan File::pushd
exit
</command></screen>

          <para>Assuming all went well, the <filename>Build.PL</filename>
          script will have created a new script named
          <filename>Build</filename> which we will use to create, test and
          install <application>Publican</application> 2.9.</para>

          <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <command>./Build
</command></screen>

          <para>There will be lots of text scrolling up the screen for a few
          minutes, you should eventually see the following:</para>

          <screen><computeroutput>DEBUG: Publican::Builder: end of build</computeroutput></screen>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para>Test the build:</para>

          <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <command>./Build test
</command></screen>

          <para>Again, lots of scrolling text at the end of which you may see
          the following:</para>

          <screen><computeroutput>Test Summary Report</computeroutput>

<computeroutput>Result: FAIL</computeroutput>
<computeroutput>Failed 2/10 test programs. 2/68 subtests failed.</computeroutput></screen>

          <para>Don't worry. This is because of a missing
          <application>wkhtmltopdf</application> utility which is undergoing
          tests to be added to <application>Publican</application> in the
          future to replace Apache <application>FOP</application> as the pdf
          generation tool of choice. If <application>Publican</application>
          finds <application>wkhtmltopdf</application> it will use it,
          otherwise it uses <application>FOP</application>.</para>

          <para>Unfortunately, at the time of writing, because OpenSuse names
          one of the dependencies of <application>wkhtmltopdf</application>
          differently (<filename>ghostscript-fonts-std</filename> as opposed
          to <filename>ghostscript-fonts</filename>)
          <application>wkhtmltopdf</application> will not run even if force
          installed with no dependency checks.</para>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para>Install <application>wkhtmltopdf</application>.</para>

          <para>This step is optional. At the time of writing
          <application>wkhtmltopdf</application> did not work on OpenSuse 12.1
          However, as the problems which prevent it working correctly from
          <application>Publican</application> may have been resolved, the
          following instructions give details on installing
          <application>wkhtmltopdf</application>.</para>

          <note>
            <para>If you intend to create indices in your generated pdf
            documents, you are advised to use <application>Apache
            FOP</application> rather than
            <application>wkhtmltopdf</application>. With
            <application>FOP</application> you get actual page numbers which
            is better in a printed document.</para>
          </note>

          <para>Once downloaded, install both rpms as follows:</para>

          <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <command>sudo sh
rpm -ivh wkhtmltopdf-qt*
rpm -ivh --nodeps wkhtmltopdf-0*
exit
</command></screen>

          <para>You have to use the option to ignore dependencies on the
          latter rpm due to the <filename>ghostscript-fonts</filename> problem
          described above.</para>
        </step>

        <step>
          <para>Install <application>Publican</application>.</para>

          <para>The final stage is to install Publican, even though the
          testing stage had a couple of sub-tests which failed.</para>

          <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <command>sudo sh
./Build test
exit
</command></screen>

          <para>The following steps are optional but it's a good idea to test
          that everything is working before you spend time on your own
          documents.</para>

            <para>At the time of writing, creating epubs with
