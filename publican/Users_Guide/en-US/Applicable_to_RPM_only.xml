	<title>Packages other than RPM packages</title>
	<para>
		This section discusses packaging documents for distribution through the <application>RPM Package Manager</application>. However, when you use the <command>publican package</command> command, <application>Publican</application> generates a tarball that you can use to build a package to distribute through different package manager software. If you run <command>publican package</command> on a computer on which <application>rpmbuild</application> is not installed, <application>Publican</application> still generates the tarball, even though it cannot then generate an RPM package from it.
