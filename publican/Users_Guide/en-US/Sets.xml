	<title>Using sets</title>
	 <para>
		A <firstterm>set</firstterm> is a collection of books, published as a single output. The <citetitle>Services Plan</citetitle> for example is a set comprised of many books such as the <citetitle>Developer Guide</citetitle>, <citetitle>Engineering Content Services Guide</citetitle> and the <citetitle>Engineering Operations Guide</citetitle> to name just a few. The <command>create_book</command> command creates a template for a set by setting the <parameter>type</parameter> parameter to <literal>Set</literal>. There are two types of sets, <firstterm>stand-alone sets</firstterm> and <firstterm>distributed sets</firstterm>.

		<title>Stand-alone sets</title>
		 <para>
			A stand-alone set contains the XML files for each book, all of which are located inside the directory of the set.
		</para>
		 <para>
			The procedure that follows will guide you through the process of creating a stand-alone set named <citetitle>My Set</citetitle> located in a directory called <filename>books/My_Set/</filename>. The set will contain <citetitle>Book A</citetitle> and <citetitle>Book B</citetitle> both of which will be manually created inside the <filename>books/My_Set/en-US</filename> directory.

Ensure that <filename>Book_A.xml</filename> contains the correct <sgmltag>xi:include</sgmltag> references to all of your xml files in the directory. For example, if <citetitle>Book A</citetitle> contained <filename>Book_Info.xml</filename> and <filename>Chapter_1.xml</filename>, the <filename>Book_A.xml</filename> file would look like this:
