	<title>Important â€” 444 pixels is the maximum safe width</title>
	 <para>
		Do not use the <parameter>max_image_width</parameter> parameter if your images contain important information. Images wider than 444 pixels presented at their full size might lead to poorly presented HTML and to PDF output that it is unusable because the images have run off the page and are incomplete.
	</para>
	 <para>
		Conversely, images wider than 444 pixels that are scaled down in a web browser to fit the HTML container or in a PDF viewer to for a page lose quality.
	</para>
	 <para>
		To safeguard the quality of your images, crop them or scale them so that they are no wider than 444 pixels before you include them in a document.
	</para>
