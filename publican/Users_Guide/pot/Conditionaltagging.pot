msgid "In this example, the only paragraphs where the meaning flows logically from one to the next is between paragraphs three and four. Because both of these paragraphs appear in the book for the beta version of the product, they (hopefully) make sense together. Beyond that, the use of conditionals here requires translators to translate individual small chunks of content without the ability to follow the context from one paragraph to the next. When translators must work under these conditions, the quality of the translation will suffer, or the time required — and therefore the cost of translation — will increase."

Without that knowledge, when translators proofread a document, they will wonder why they cannot find text that they know they translated and can find easily in the PO file. If you must use conditionals in your book, you must be prepared to provide a greater degree of support to your translators than you would otherwise provide."

For example, the <filename>upstream.cfg</filename> file might contain the condition <literal>condition: upstream</literal> and the <filename>enterprise.cfg</filename> file might contain the condition <literal>condition: enterprise</literal>. You could then specify the version of the document to build or package with the <option>--config</option>; for example, <command>publican package --lang en-US --config upstream.cfg</command>. Using two separate config files saves you from having to edit the one config file each time you build or package a document."
