RPM packages are used to distribute software to computers with Linux operating systems that use the <application>RPM Package Manager</application>. These operating systems include Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, Mandriva Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise, openSUSE, Turbolinux, and Yellow Dog Linux, to name just a few."
