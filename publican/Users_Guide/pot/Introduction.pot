It is not a general DocBook XML tutorial; refer to <citetitle>DocBook: The Definitive Guide</citetitle> by Norman Walsh and Leonard Muellner, available at <ulink url=\"http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/docbook.html\" /> for more general help with DocBook XML."

msgid "Entities, for example, can be validly defined in any XML file. However, to ensure the DTD declaration is present, valid and standardized, <application>Publican</application> rewrites the declaration in every XML file before it builds a book or article. Consequently, all entities declared in all XML files are lost. <application>Publican</application>, therefore, requires you define entities in the <filename><replaceable>Doc_Name</replaceable>.ent</filename> file (refer to <xref linkend=\"sect-Users_Guide-Files_in_the_book_directory-Doc_Name.ent\" />)."

msgid "As publishing workflows grow, unrestrained entity definition leads to entity duplication and other practices that cause maintenance difficulties. Consolidating entity definitions in a single, predictable place alleviates these maintenance issues and helps the automation of the build process stay robust."

msgid "Entities also present an essentially insurmountable obstacle to quality translation (refer to <xref linkend=\"sect-Users_Guide-Entities_and_translation\" />). Consequently, while we are not reducing the <filename><replaceable>Doc_Name</replaceable>.ent</filename> file's functionality, we are no longer considering requests to add functionality or features associated with entity use."
