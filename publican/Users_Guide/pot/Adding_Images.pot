Make sure that the image file in the translated language has the same name as the image file in the original language.

msgid "Large images present poorly in HTML because they often go beyond the right margin of the text. Similarly, images wider than 444 pixels often go beyond the right margin of PDF pages and are cropped so that only the left side of the image is visible. Therefore, by default, <application>Publican</application> creates HTML and PDF output that instructs web browsers and PDF viewers to scale down any images larger than 444 pixels wide. Note, however, that images lose quality significantly when scaled in this way. For best results, scale or crop your images in image editing software so that they are no more than 444 pixels wide before you place them in a document."
