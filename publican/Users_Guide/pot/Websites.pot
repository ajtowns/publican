msgid "<application>Publican</application> not only builds documents for publication but can build and manage a documentation website as well. For a suite of documents that you maintain by yourself, you can use <application>Publican</application> to build a site on your local system; you can then upload the site to a webserver by whatever means you choose. This approach does not scale well, however, so for team-based documentation projects, <application>Publican</application> can generate RPM packages of documentation to install on the webserver. To install <application>Publican</application>-generated RPM packages on a webserver, <application>Publican</application> (version 2.1 or higher) and <application>rpm</application> must be installed on the server. If you build and maintain the website on a workstation and upload it to a webserver for publication, <application>Publican</application> and <application>rpm</application> do not need to be installed on the webserver."

A Sitemap does not guarantee that your site will be ranked higher in search results.
