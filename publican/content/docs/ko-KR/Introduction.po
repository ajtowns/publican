"guide explains how to to create and build books and articles using publican. "
"It is not a DocBook XML tutorial and concentrates solely on using the "
"publican tools. See <ulink url=\"http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/docbook.html"

"Publican is a publication system, not just a DocBook processing tool. As "

"The Branding functionality allows you to create your own presentation rules "

"Entities, for example, can be validly defined in any XML file. However, to "
"ensure the DTD declaration is present, valid and standardized, Publican "
"rewrites the declaration in every XML file before it builds a book or "
"article. Consequently, all entities declared in all XML files are lost. "
"Publican, therefore, requires you define Entities in the "
"<filename><replaceable>Book_Name</replaceable>.ent</filename> file (see "
"<xref linkend=\"sect-Publican-Files_in_the_Book_directory-Book_Name.ent\"/>)."

"As publishing workflows grow, unrestrained Entity definition leads to Entity "
"duplication and other practices that cause maintenance difficulties. "
"Consolidating Entity definitions in a single, predictable place alleviates "
"these maintenance issues and helps the automation of the build process stay "
"robust."
