				<para>
					I have extensive code samples for my book, how can I include them without having to xml escape everything?
				</para>
			</question>

				<para>
					The best way to do this is to create a directory named <filename>extras</filename> in your source language directory and use an <sgmltag>xi:include</sgmltag> to pull in the code file.
				</para>
				<procedure id="proc-Users_Guide-Frequently_Asked_Questions-Including_code_samples">
					<title>Including code samples</title>
					<step>
						<para>
							Create the extras directory 
<programlisting><command>mkdir <filename>en-US/extras</filename></command>
</programlisting>
						</para>
					</step>
					<step>
						<para>
							Copy the code file to the extras directory 
<programlisting><command>cp <filename>~/samples/foo.c en-US/extras/.</filename></command>

						</para>
					</step>
					<step>
						<para>
							<sgmltag>xi:include</sgmltag> the sample file in your xml file 
<programlisting language="xml">&lt;programlisting&gt;
&lt;xi:include parse="text" href="extras/foo.c" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" /&gt;
&lt;/programlisting&gt;
</programlisting>
						</para>
					</step>
					<step>
						<para>
							You can now edit <filename>en-US/extras/foo.c</filename> in your favorite editor without having to be concerned about how it will affect the XML.

					<title>Important</title>
					<para>
						The <filename>files</filename> directory will not be available during the validation process so you can not <sgmltag>xi:include</sgmltag> or otherwise embed any files in this directory in your XML.

			<question>
				<para>
					I get an error saying Batik is not in the classpath but batik is installed! What is wrong?
				</para>
			</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
					We believe this is due to classpath issues caused by having different JRE and JDK versions installed. Sometimes this can be fixed by upgrading your JDK to the same version of your JRE.
				</para>
				<para>
					Sometimes this issue can be revealed by running <command>alternatives --config java</command> and <command>alternatives --config javac</command>, if the versions are different then selecting the same version in both can fix this problem.
				</para>
				<para>
					Some Java installs do not set-up the <command>alternatives</command> environment correctly, no fix has been determined for this situation.
				</para>

			<question>
				<para>
					I get an error <computeroutput>Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space</computeroutput> when trying to build PDF. What is wrong?
				</para>
			</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
					The default memory allocated for Java is not big enough to build your PDF. You need to increase the memory allocated to FOP. Before running <command>make </command> run <command>echo "FOP_OPTS=&#39;-Xms50m -Xmx700m&#39;" &gt; ~/.foprc</command>. This sets the initial heap space to 50MB and allows it to grow to a maximum of 700MB.
