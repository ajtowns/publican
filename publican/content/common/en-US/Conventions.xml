	<title>Document Conventions</title>

	<para>
	This manual uses several type and presentation conventions to highlight certain words and phrases and specific important pieces of information.
	</para>

	<section id="Typographic_Conventions">
		<title>Typographic Conventions</title>

		<para>
		Four typographic conventions are used to call attention to specific words and phrases. These conventions, and the types of phrases they apply to, are as follows.
		</para>

		<para>
		<command>Mono-spaced Bold</command>
		</para>

		<para>
		This denotes words and phrases that will or could be input on a system, including shell commands, file names and paths. It is also used to highlight key caps and key-combinations you can press as shortcuts. For example:
		</para>

		<blockquote>
			<para>
			To see the contents of the file <filename>my_next_bestselling_novel</filename> in your current working directory, enter the <command>cat my_next_bestselling_novel</command> command at the shell prompt and press <keycap>Enter</keycap> to execute the command.
			</para>

			<para>
			A useful shortcut for the above command (and many others) is <keycap>Tab</keycap> completion. Type <command>cat my_</command> and then press the <keycap>Tab</keycap> key. Assuming there are no other files in the current directory which begin with 'my_', the rest of the file name will be entered on the command line for you.
			</para>

			<para>
			(If other file names begin with 'my_', pressing the <keycap>Tab</keycap> key expands the file name to the point the names differ. Press <keycap>Tab</keycap> again to see all the files that match. Type enough of the file name you want to include on the command line to distinguish the file you want from the others and press <keycap>Tab</keycap> again.)
			</para>
		</blockquote>

		<para>
		The above includes a file name, a shell command and two key caps, all distinctly presented in Mono-spaced Bold and all distinguishable thanks to context.
		</para>
		<para>
		Key-combinations can be distinguished from key caps by the hyphen connecting each part of a key-combination. For example:
		</para>

		<blockquote>
			<para>
				Press <keycap>Enter</keycap> to execute the command.
			</para>

			<para>
				Press <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F1</keycap></keycombo> to switch to the first virtual terminal. Press <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F7</keycap></keycombo> to return to your X-Windows session.
			</para>
		</blockquote>

		<para>
		The first sentence above highlights a specific key cap to press. The second highlights two sets of three keys, each set pressed simultaneously.
		</para>

		<para>
		If source code is discussed, class names, methods, functions, variable names and returned values mentioned within a paragraph will be presented as above, in <literal>Mono-spaced Bold</literal>. For example:
		</para>

		<blockquote>
			<para>
			File-related classes include <classname>filesystem</classname> for file systems, <classname>file</classname> for files, and <classname>dir</classname> for directories. Each class has its own associated set of permissions.
			</para>
		</blockquote>

		<para>
		In PDF and paper editions, a specific typeface is used: <literal>12-point Liberation Mono Bold</literal>. This typeface is also used in HTML editions, if the <ulink url="https://fedorahosted.org/liberation-fonts/">Liberation Fonts</ulink> are installed on your system: an equivalent mono-spaced bold face is used otherwise. Note: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and later include the Liberation Fonts set by default.
		</para>

		<para>
		<application>Proportional Bold</application>
		</para>

		<para>
		This style denotes words or phrases you will encounter on a system. This includes application names; dialogue box text; labelled buttons; check-box and radio button labels; menu titles and sub-menu titles. For example:
		</para>

		<blockquote>
			<para>
			Choose <guimenu>System > Preferences > Mouse</guimenu> from the main menu bar to launch the <application>Mouse Preferences</application> utility. In the <guilabel>Buttons</guilabel> tab, click the <guilabel>Left-handed mouse</guilabel> check box and click <guibutton>Close</guibutton> to switch the primary mouse button from the left to the right (making the mouse suitable for use in the left hand).
			</para>

			<para>
			To insert a special character into a <application>gedit</application> file, choose <guimenu>Applications > Accessories > Character Map</guimenu> from the main menu bar. Next, choose <guimenu>Search > Find&hellip;</guimenu> from the <application>Character Map</application> menu bar, type the name of the character in the <guilabel>Search</guilabel> field and click <guibutton>Next</guibutton>. The character you sought will be highlighted in the <guilabel>Character Table</guilabel>. Double-click this highlighted character to place it in the <guilabel>Text to copy</guilabel> field and then click the <guibutton>Copy</guibutton> button. Now switch back to your document and choose <guimenu>Edit > Paste</guimenu> from the <application>gedit</application> menu bar.
			</para>
		</blockquote>

		<para>
		The above text includes application names; system-wide menu names and items; application-specific menu names; and buttons and text found within a GUI interface, all distinctly presented in Proportional Bold and all distinguishable by context.
		</para>

		<para>
		Note the <guimenu>></guimenu> shorthand used to indicate traversal through a menu and its sub-menus. This is to avoid the verbose and difficult-to-follow 'Select <guimenuitem>Mouse</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Preferences</guimenu> sub-menu in the <guimenu>System</guimenu> menu of the main menu bar' approach.
		</para>

		<para>
		In PDF and paper editions, a specific typeface is used: <application>12-point Liberation Sans Bold</application>. This typeface is also used in HTML editions, if the <ulink url="https://fedorahosted.org/liberation-fonts/">Liberation Fonts</ulink> are installed on your system: an equivalent proportional bold face is used otherwise. Note: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and later include the Liberation Fonts set by default.
		</para>

		<para>
		<replaceable>Mono-spaced Bold Italic</replaceable>
		</para>

		<para>
		This style denotes replaceable or variable text. It it used to denote text you do not input literally or displayed text that changes depending on circumstance. For example:
		</para>

		<blockquote>
		<para>
		To connect to a remote machine using ssh, type <command>ssh</command> <replaceable>username@domain.name</replaceable> at a shell prompt. If the remote machine is <filename>example.com</filename> and your username on that machine is john, you type <command>ssh john@example.com</command>.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		The <command>mount -o remount</command> <replaceable>file-system</replaceable> command remount the named file system. For example, to remount the <filename>/home</filename> file system, the command is <command>mount -o remount /home</command>.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		To see the version of a currently installed package, use the <command>rpm -q</command> <replaceable>package</replaceable> command. It will return a result as follows: <replaceable>package-version-release</replaceable>.
		</para>
		</blockquote>
		
		<para>
		Note the words in bold italics above &mdash; username, domain.name, file-system, package, version and release. Each word is a placeholder, either for text you would replace with specific examples when entering a command or for specific text that would be displayed by the system.
		</para>

		<para>
		In PDF and paper editions, a specific typeface is used: <replaceable>12-point Liberation Mono Bold Italic</replaceable>. This typeface is also used in HTML editions, if the <ulink url="https://fedorahosted.org/liberation-fonts/">Liberation Fonts</ulink> are installed on your system: an equivalent proportional bold italic face is used otherwise. Note: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and later include the Liberation Fonts set by default.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		<firstterm>Proportional Italic</firstterm>
		</para>

		<para>
		Aside from standard usage as a marker for the formal title of a work (eg a book title), italic is used to denote the first time a new and important term is used. For example:
		</para>
		
		<blockquote>
			<para>
			When the Apache HTTP Server accepts requests, it dispatches child processes or threads to handle them. This group of child processes or threads is known as a <firstterm>server-pool</firstterm>. Under Apache HTTP Server 2.0, the responsibility for creating and maintaining these server-pools has been abstracted to a group of modules called <firstterm>Multi-Processing Modules</firstterm> (<firstterm>MPMs</firstterm>). Unlike other modules, only one module from the MPM group can be loaded by the Apache HTTP Server.
			</para>
		</blockquote>
		
		<para>
		In PDF and paper editions, a specific typeface is used: <firstterm>12-point Liberation Italic</firstterm>. This typeface is also used in HTML editions, if the <ulink url="https://fedorahosted.org/liberation-fonts/">Liberation Fonts</ulink> are installed on your system: an equivalent proportional italic face is used otherwise. Note: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and later include the Liberation Fonts set by default.
		</para>

	</section>

	<section id="Pull-quote_Conventions">
		<title>Pull-quote Conventions</title>
		
		<para>
		Two, commonly multi-line, data types are set off visually from the surrounding text.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		Output sent to a terminal is set in <computeroutput>Mono-spaced Roman</computeroutput> and presented thus:
		</para>

<screen>
books        Desktop   documentation  drafts  mss    photos   stuff  svn
books_tests  Desktop1  downloads      images  notes  scripts  svgs
</screen>

		<para>
		Source-code listings are also set in <computeroutput>Mono-spaced Roman</computeroutput> but are presented and highlighted as follows:
		</para>

<programlisting language="java">
package org.jboss.book.jca.ex1;

import javax.naming.InitialContext;

public class ExClient
{
   public static void main(String args[]) 
       throws Exception
   {
      InitialContext iniCtx = new InitialContext();
      Object         ref    = iniCtx.lookup("EchoBean");
      EchoHome       home   = (EchoHome) ref;
      Echo           echo   = home.create();

      System.out.println("Created Echo");

      System.out.println("Echo.echo('Hello') = " + echo.echo("Hello"));
   }
   
}
</programlisting>

		<para>
		As with the in-line conventions,a specific typeface is used  in PDF and print editions: <computeroutput>12-point Liberation Mono</computeroutput>. Again, as with in-line styles, if the <ulink url="https://fedorahosted.org/liberation-fonts/">Liberation Fonts</ulink> are installed on your system, the same typeface is used in HTML editions: an equivalent mono-spaced roman face will be displayed otherwise. 
		</para>

	</section>
	<section id="Notes_and_Warnings">
		<title>Notes and Warnings</title>
		
		<para>
		Finally, we use three distinct visual styles to highlight certain information nuggets.
		</para>
		
		<note>
		<title>Note</title>
		<para>
		A note is a useful information tidbit: a tip or shortcut or an alternative approach to the task at hand. Ignoring a note should have no negative consequences, but you might miss out on a trick that makes your life easier.
		</para>
		</note>
		
		<important>
		<title>Important</title>
		<para>
		The Important  information box highlights details that are easily missed: such as configuration changes that only apply to the current session, or services that need restarting before an update will apply. Ignoring important information won't cause data loss but may cause irritation and frustration.
		</para>
		</important>
		
		
		<warning>
		<title>Warning</title>
		<para>
		A Warning highlights vital information that must not be ignored. Ignoring warnings will most likely cause data loss.
		</para>
		</warning>
	</section>
</section>
